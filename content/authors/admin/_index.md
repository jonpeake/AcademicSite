I am a PhD Candidate studying broad-scale dynamics of western Atlantic teleost communities. I also hold a position as a research scientist at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, where I provide computational, field, and laboratory support for the Fisheries-Independent Monitoring program. In addition to being a fish geek, I have a passion for mathematics and hold a Bachelor of Science degree from University of Miami with majors in Marine Science, Biology, and Statistics. My research interests include marine ecology, spatiotemporal dynamics of fishes across multiple scales of space, time, and biological organization, open source science, spatial and community analysis in R, and species distribution modeling. I am particularly fascinated with metacommunity theory, which seeks to reconcile the local and regional processes that influence the distribution of organisms in space and time.
